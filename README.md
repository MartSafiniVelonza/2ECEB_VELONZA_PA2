#NORMALIZATION PROBLEM

1. Import the NumPy library for numerical operations.
2. Create a random 5 x 5 ndarray, then store it in variable 'x'.
3. Normalize the ndarray by subtracting x and its mean and dividing it by the standard deviation.
4. Save the normalized array to a file named X_normalized.npy.
5. Output the normalized array.


#DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM

1. Import the NumPy library for numerical operations.
2. Create an array with integers from 1 to 100.
3. Use sqrnum or square number to get the square of all the elements in array 'a'.
4. Reshape the squared numbers into a 10 x 10 and name it 'A'.
5. Output the squared numbers.
6. Get only the elements from 'A' that are divisible by 3 by using '%'.
7. Output the elements divisible by 3.
8. Save the result to a file named div_by_3.npy.
9. Load the div_by_3.npy into the variable 'loaded'.
10. Output the loaded array of elements divisible by 3.
